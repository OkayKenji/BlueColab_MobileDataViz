### About the Project
Knowing what's in your water - is a human right. The AquaWatch Mobile App bring water data right to your finger tips. While the current scope of the app is limited to pond and river data, we hope to set an example for what's possible. 

One day you'll know what's in the water that's coming out of your tap.

#### Features
- Informative data visualization of water quality metrics.
- Monthly water quality reports with graphical representations.
- Information about local wildlife and its dependence on water quality.
- Access to Blue CoLab blogs.
