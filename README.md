<h3> Design Process </h3>
<p> Our team utilized the Agile methodology in order to develop this project. Early into the development process, each member took on a lead role in overseeing a major component of the project. From there, it was each member's responsibility to communicate updates to the team and seek advice or assistance if any issues were encountered. This approach fostered open collaboration and allowed each member to contribute to each aspect of the project as needed.

All tasks and components are documented within a sprint backlog. Sprint retrospectives were held at the end of each sprint.

Wireframes and architecture diagrams for the project shown below.
